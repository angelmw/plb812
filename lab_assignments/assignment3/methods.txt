Data is paired end so used trimmomatic paired end.
Set the variable sra for the SRR names. Used a loop to use trimmomatic on each fastq.gz file in my RNA-seq directory and output as trimmed.fastq.gz in a separate directory, RNA-seq_trimmed.
I used LEADING and TAILING to cut off reads at each end below a quality of 20.
There was no adapter content in the FastQC Reports so I didn't cut adapters from the read.

Ran fastqc on the trimmed files and output into another directory, RNA-seq_trimmed_fastqc.
Copied the html files in RNA-seq_trimmed_fastqc to assignment3 directory.

All of my html files were empty so I redid it with LEADING and TAILING of 10 and ILLUMINA for TruSeq3. I couldn't find what adapters were used but I'm guessing TruSeq3 based on the platform used and year.
